The game is played by trying to click cells to clear them without hitting bombs. The game can be played on Easy, Medium, or Hard, with each subsequent level
increasing the grid size and number of bombs. The number on a cell indicates how many cells in the surrounding cells in 8 directions are bombs, and cells with 0 surrounding bombs automatically clear out adjacent cells.
The first click is guaranteed to have 0 surrounding cells. Left click to clear and right click to "flag" a cell to indicate you think that there's a bomb there.
Flagged cells will not be cleared with a left click.

Once all of the non-bomb cells are cleared, you will win the game.
